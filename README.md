## Problem Statement 
Predicting daily mushroom yield (kg) in a climate-controlled polyhouse using real-world sensor 
readings for temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), and CO₂ (ppm). This repository serves as a 
version-controlled data pipeline resilient against model breakdown due to sudden hardware or 
data drift updates.

## Data Cleaning Strategy Log (Phase 1, Task 2)

**1. Outliers & Anomalies (Threshold Rules)**
Filtered humidity (50-100%), temperature (10-35°C), and CO2 (400-2000 ppm) to remove hard sensor failures (e.g., a dead humidity probe reading 0% or environmental spikes outside biological survival ranges). 

**2. Missing Values (Imputation vs. Row Removal)**
Handled short sensor dropouts (power blips, calibration gaps) using forward-fill (`ffill`) with a strict limit of 2 periods, assuming short-term microclimate stability. Rows completely missing the `yield_kg` target variable were dropped entirely, as we cannot train or evaluate models on missing ground-truth labels.

**3. Duplicates**
Removed exact timestamp duplicates, keeping the `last` entry under the assumption it represents the most recent or corrected system export.


# Data Cleaning Strategy & Log

## Missing Values
* **Initial Report:** Printed and reviewed prior to pipeline execution.
* **Sensor Gaps:** Short gaps (limit=2) in `temperature_c`, `humidity_pct`, and `co2_ppm` were imputed using forward-fill (`ffill`), assuming short-term MCAR dropouts (e.g., power blips).
* **Target Variable:** Rows with missing `yield_kg` after forward-filling were explicitly dropped.

## Outliers & Anomalies
* **Threshold Filters:** Applied explicit bounding rules for an oyster mushroom polyhouse. Readings outside these ranges were treated as sensor failures (e.g., dead probes) rather than rare microclimate events.
* **Ranges:** Humidity (50-100%), Temperature (10-35°C), CO2 (400-2000 ppm). 

## Duplicates
* **Resolution:** Duplicate timestamps, likely caused by double exports, were removed. The `last` recorded reading for any duplicate timestamp was kept.

# Mushroom Yield Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a data pipeline and machine learning workflow for predicting mushroom yield using polyhouse sensor data. The dataset contains environmental measurements such as temperature, humidity, and CO₂ concentration collected from cultivation units.

The project is structured to support data ingestion, validation, preprocessing, model training, and deployment-ready model storage.


## cleaning log ## 

loaded clean.py file into src

This script performs data cleaning and preprocessing using several common techniques:
1 Missing value analysis
2 Range-based filtering (data validation)
3 Null target removal
4 Forward-fill imputation
5 Deletion of missing targets
6 Deduplication

Overall Cleaning Strategy

This is a combination of:

1 Data Validation Cleaning
  Filters out out-of-range sensor readings.
2 Missing Value Treatment
  Forward-fill imputation for sensor data.
  Row deletion for missing target values.
3 Data Deduplication
  Removes duplicate timestamps.
4 Quality-Based Filtering
  Retains only records that satisfy predefined oyster polyhouse environmental conditions.

Duplicate records were identified using the timestamp column and removed while retaining the latest occurrence. A total of 0 duplicate records were removed, resulting in a final cleaned dataset containing 365 rows.

02_cleaned.parquet was successfully loaded and validated. The target column (yield_kg) contains 0 missing values, confirming that all records are suitable for downstream analysis and model training.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the relationships between environmental sensor measurements and mushroom yield. The analysis helps identify patterns in the data before building machine learning models.

## Dataset Features

The following features were analyzed:

* `temperature_c` – Temperature in degrees Celsius
* `humidity_pct` – Relative humidity percentage
* `co2_ppm` – Carbon dioxide concentration in parts per million
* `yield_kg` – Mushroom yield in kilograms

## Visualizations

### 1. Correlation Heatmap

A Pearson correlation heatmap was generated to visualize the strength and direction of relationships between all numerical features.

Output:

* `reports/figures/corr_heatmap.png`

### 2. Scatter Plots

Scatter plots were created to examine the relationship between yield and each environmental variable:

* Humidity vs Yield
* Temperature vs Yield
* CO₂ vs Yield

Output:

* `reports/figures/scatter_yield.png`

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Running the Analysis

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Run the EDA script:

```bash
python src/eda.py
```

## Generated Files

```text
reports/
├── eda_notes.md
└── figures/
    ├── corr_heatmap.png
    └── scatter_yield.png
```

## Observations

* Correlation analysis helps identify relationships among variables.
* Scatter plots provide a visual understanding of trends between sensor readings and mushroom yield.
* Findings from EDA can guide feature selection and model development.

## Limitations

* Correlation does not imply causation.
* Pearson correlation only captures linear relationships.
* Outliers may influence correlation values and visual interpretations.
